## 🚀 Summary

This PR implements **5 major enterprise-grade AI enhancements** that transform the LangChain assistant into a production-ready, intelligent context management system.

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 1. 🎯 Context-Aware Entity Generation
**IPC Handler:** `langchain:generateContextAware`

- Generates entities with **full awareness** of existing context repository structure
- Auto-suggests next available IDs following naming patterns (FEAT-XXX, US-XXX, etc.)
- Validates entity IDs against existing entities to prevent duplicates
- Auto-links to related entities (features, specs, tasks, services)
- Schema-aware generation with **strict JSON Schema validation**

**Use Case:** *"Create a new user story for OAuth login linked to FEAT-002"* → AI generates valid YAML with correct ID, proper links, and schema compliance.

### 2. 📊 Intelligent Impact Analysis
**IPC Handler:** `langchain:analyzeImpact`

- Analyzes impact of proposed changes with **AI-powered natural language explanations**
- Builds and traverses dependency graphs to find all affected entities
- Generates realistic **effort estimates** ("2-4 hours", "1-2 days")
- Provides **risk assessments** (breaking changes, inconsistencies)
- Suggests actionable recommendations (status changes, reviews needed)

**Use Case:** *"What happens if I change the acceptance criteria for STORY-042?"* → AI explains downstream impacts on tasks, specs, and services with specific actions to take.

### 3. 🔄 Conversational Validation
**IPC Handler:** `langchain:refineYaml`

- Multi-turn YAML refinement through **natural language dialogue**
- Explains JSON Schema validation errors in **plain English**
- Iteratively fixes YAML until schema-valid
- Preserves user intent while correcting syntax errors
- Educational feedback helps users learn schema requirements

**Use Case:** When YAML validation fails, instead of cryptic errors, AI explains *"The status field must be one of: todo, doing, done, blocked"* and fixes it automatically.

### 4. 🔍 Semantic Search
**IPC Handler:** `langchain:semanticSearch`

- **Enterprise-grade Faiss** vector store for production-ready similarity search
- Azure OpenAI embeddings for high-quality semantic understanding
- Search across all entity types (features, stories, specs, tasks)
- AI-generated explanations for why results are relevant
- **Cached vector stores** for optimal performance

**Use Case:** *"Find all stories related to authentication flow"* → Returns semantically similar entities even if they don't mention "authentication" explicitly, with AI explanations of relevance.

### 5. 🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration
**IPC Handler:** `langchain:executeWorkflow`

- Plan-based workflow execution for **complex multi-step tasks**
- Breaks down user instructions into tool-based steps
- Coordinates multiple operations (create entity, validate, analyze impact)
- Foundation for future **LangChain ReAct agent** implementation

**Use Case:** *"Create a new feature for SSO with related stories, tasks, and impact analysis"* → AI plans and executes entire workflow.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Improvements

### Configuration Enhancements
- ✅ Added **Embedding Model** configuration to AI Settings UI
- ✅ Separate embedding model field for Azure OpenAI (defaults to `text-embedding-ada-002`)
- ✅ Persisted in `.context/ai-config.json` alongside chat model
- ✅ UI shows helpful hints about available embedding models

### Bug Fixes
- ✅ Fixed Azure OpenAI `apiKey` parameter requirement in `ChatOpenAI` constructor
- ✅ Proper credential resolution across all enhanced features
- ✅ Consistent error handling and logging

### Type Safety
- ✅ Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- ✅ All new methods properly typed
- ✅ Zero type errors (`pnpm typecheck` passes)
- ✅ ESLint clean in new service

## 📦 Dependencies

### Added (Production)
- `langchain@1.0.2` - Core LangChain framework
- `@langchain/community@1.0.0` - Community integrations
- `faiss-node@0.5.1` - **Enterprise-grade vector database** (used by major companies)

### Why Faiss?
- Battle-tested by Meta AI Research
- Production-ready performance (millions of vectors)
- Native C++ implementation for speed
- Industry standard for vector similarity search

## 📊 Impact

### Lines Changed
- **+1,362 insertions**
- **6 files changed**
- **1 new service** (`EnhancedLangChainService.ts`)
- **5 new IPC handlers**

### Breaking Changes
**NONE** - All features are **additive**. Existing functionality remains unchanged.

### Backward Compatibility
✅ Fully backward compatible
- Existing AI config structure preserved
- New `embeddingModel` field is optional (defaults applied)
- Existing IPC handlers unchanged

## 🧪 Testing

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: **PASS** (`pnpm typecheck`)
- ✅ ESLint: **PASS** for new files
- ✅ All interfaces properly typed
- ✅ Error handling validated
