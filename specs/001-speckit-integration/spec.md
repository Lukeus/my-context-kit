# Feature Specification: Spec Kit Context Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-speckit-integration`  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Extend Context-Sync so it uses Speckit as the engine github/spec-kit that generates context inside context-repo, and adjust the ui to dispaly the md files as the entities. The work spans a deterministic main-process IPC services for repository hydration, renderer updates to drive the new generator, and validation coverage that guarantees generated entities still pass schema, impact, and prompt pipelines."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-28

- Q: What freshness threshold should block entity publication when the Spec Kit cache is stale? â†’ A: Require refresh when cache exceeds 7 days

### User Story 1 - Product manager seeds context from Spec Kit (Priority: P1)

A product manager wants to pull the latest Spec Kit guidance into the project so the context repository mirrors GitHub's canonical documentation.

**Why this priority**: Without a dependable fetch, downstream entity generation cannot use Spec Kit as the source of truth, halting the initiative.

**Independent Test**: Trigger a Spec Kit fetch on a clean workspace and verify the cache snapshot is populated and committed without manual edits.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the product manager selects "Fetch Spec Kit" inside Context-Sync, **When** the request completes, **Then** the context repo contains a timestamped cache with Spec Kit docs and templates recorded in the fetch summary.
2. **Given** the product manager has already fetched the latest tag, **When** they rerun the fetch, **Then** the system reports no new changes and retains the current cache without corrupting existing entities.

### User Story 2 - Developer previews Spec Kit content as entities (Priority: P2)

A developer needs to browse Spec Kit markdown inside the app to understand how it maps to features, stories, and specs before generating YAML files.

**Why this priority**: Visualizing the fetched documentation prevents misaligned entity creation and keeps the UI consistent with the canonical source.

**Independent Test**: Load the renderer view after a fetch and confirm markdown files render in the entity panel with navigation and search.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the developer opens the Spec Kit library in Context-Sync, **When** they pick any fetched markdown file, **Then** the UI displays the document with headings, links, and metadata without leaving the app.
2. **Given** the developer filters for a specific entity type (feature, user story, spec templates), **When** the filter is applied, **Then** only matching markdown artifacts remain visible.

---

### User Story 3 - Release manager validates pipelines after Spec Kit-driven updates (Priority: P3)

A release manager must ensure that any entities generated from Spec Kit content continue to pass schema validation, graph, impact, and prompt pipelines before approval.

**Why this priority**: Guarding pipeline integrity avoids shipping broken context artifacts that could desync teams relying on the repository.

**Independent Test**: Generate sample entities from the new flow and confirm all context-repo pipelines succeed without manual intervention.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** entities were produced from Spec Kit markdown, **When** the automated pipelines run, **Then** each pipeline reports success and the UI surfaces the pass/fail status.
2. **Given** a pipeline fails due to malformed content, **When** the release manager views the result, **Then** the error message points to the offending entity and the original markdown source.

### Edge Cases

- Remote repository fetch retries when GitHub is unreachable, with a clear status indicating the last successful sync.
- Handling a Spec Kit release that removes or renames templates referenced by existing entities without breaking downstream pipelines.
- Preventing simultaneous fetch requests from overlapping and corrupting the cached snapshot.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow authorized users to trigger a Spec Kit fetch that clones or updates a pinned release into the context repository cache.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST record each fetch in a structured summary that includes source repository, tag or commit, timestamps, and retrieved artifact lists.
- **FR-003**: The user interface MUST present fetched markdown files grouped by entity type and allow previewing their rendered content inside the app.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST enable users to choose specific Spec Kit markdown files to seed new context entities without editing raw YAML manually.
- **FR-005**: After entities are generated from Spec Kit content, the system MUST automatically run validation, graph, impact, and prompt pipelines and display results.
- **FR-006**: If a pipeline fails, the system MUST surface actionable error details linking back to both the generated entity and originating Spec Kit source.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST block further entity publication while the cached Spec Kit snapshot is older than 7 days and prompt users to refresh before continuing.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Spec Kit Cache Snapshot**: Represents the immutable set of documents and templates pulled from `github/spec-kit`, including metadata such as release tag, commit hash, fetch timestamp, and artifact inventory.
- **Entity Preview Document**: A markdown representation selected from the cache that the UI exposes for review before transforming it into a feature, user story, or spec YAML file.
- **Pipeline Verification Report**: Captures the outcome of running validation, graph, impact, and prompt pipelines for a batch of Spec Kit-derived entities, including pass/fail status and referenced files.

### Architecture Impact (C4) *(mandatory when architecture changes)*

- Update `context-repo/c4/context-sync-mvp.md` to add the Spec Kit SaaS boundary, the fetch pipeline process, and the flow into `.context/speckit-cache`.
- Update `context-repo/c4/component-sync.md` (or successor diagram) to illustrate the new main-process fetch service, renderer preview components, and pipeline triggers.
- Ensure diagram notes emphasize that Spec Kit artifacts become part of the Git-versioned source of truth and that pipelines remain the enforcement boundary before entity publication.

### Dependencies & Assumptions

- GitHub access for `github/spec-kit` remains available and unauthenticated cloning of the public repository continues to work.
- Product, developer, and release manager roles have credentials configured in Context-Sync to interact with the context repository without bypassing pipelines.
- Spec Kit releases preserve markdown structure (front matter, heading hierarchy) so previews and entity mapping remain accurate.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of fetch operations complete in under 90 seconds and return a populated Spec Kit snapshot summary.
- **SC-002**: 100% of Spec Kit-derived entity batches pass validation, graph, impact, and prompt pipelines on the first automated run within the release manager workflow.
- **SC-003**: At least 80% of targeted markdown templates display correctly in the UI preview without formatting regressions or missing sections.
- **SC-004**: Time spent manually copying Spec Kit guidance into the context repository decreases by 70% within one iteration after launch, as reported by product stakeholders.
