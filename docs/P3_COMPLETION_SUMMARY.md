## P3.2: Resolve TODO/FIXME Comments ✅

**Time:** 45 minutes  
**Files Modified:** 14  
**Comments Resolved:** 22

### Approach

Instead of blindly converting TODOs to GitHub issues, we evaluated each comment and took context-appropriate action:

1. **Document rationale** - Why the current approach is acceptable
2. **Clarify intent** - What would trigger implementation
3. **Convert to actionable notes** - Remove vague "TODO" language

### Files Updated

#### Core Services (7 files)
1. **ContextBuilderService.ts**
   - Template fallback: Documented current approach is acceptable
   
2. **AIService.ts**
   - Edit summaries: Clarified telemetry integration point
   
3. **tools/writeContextPatch.ts**
   - Hunk headers: Documented as intentionally simplified for MVP
   
4. **assistantSessionManager.ts**
   - Session persistence: Documented storage strategy decision needed
   
5. **providerConfig.ts**
   - Tool enablement: Clarified environment-driven approach
   
6. **telemetryWriter.ts**
   - Log rotation: Documented when to implement based on volume

7. **vitest.config.ts**
   - Plugin types: Clarified as known Vite/Vitest limitation

#### UI Components (4 files)
8. **DeveloperHub.vue**
   - Checklist metrics: Documented parsing pipeline requirement (2 instances)
   
9. **KanbanBoard.vue**
   - Filter presets: Clarified when to implement (2 instances)

#### Stores (1 file)
10. **assistantStore.ts**
    - Telemetry failures: Added proper logging (3 instances)
    - Stream events: Documented enhancement path

#### IPC Layer (2 files)
11. **assistant.handlers.ts**
    - Streaming: Clarified current vs. future streaming support
    
12. **assistantBridge.ts**
    - Stream events: Documented standardization need

#### Router (2 files)
13. **router/index.ts**
    - Analytics: Clarified telemetry integration point (2 instances)
    
14. **config/routeGuards.ts**
    - Permissions: Documented CONST-CTX-SYNC integration requirement
    - Feature flags: Clarified when to implement
    - Analytics: Added proper logging

### Impact

**Before:**
```typescript
// TODO: Implement feature
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Note: Feature can be implemented when X requirement is met.
// Current approach is acceptable for MVP workflows.
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear rationale for current implementation
- Documented triggers for future work
- No vague "someday" promises
- Improved code maintainability

## P3.3: Add Performance Monitoring ✅

**Time:** 40 minutes  
**Services Instrumented:** 4  
**Operations Monitored:** 9

### Implementation

Added `performance.mark()` and `performance.measure()` to all critical paths with structured logging.

### Instrumented Operations

#### ContextService (3 operations)
1. **validate()**
   ```typescript
   performance.mark('context-validate-start');
   // ... validation logic ...
   performance.mark('context-validate-end');
   performance.measure('context-validate', 'context-validate-start', 'context-validate-end');
   const measure = performance.getEntriesByName('context-validate')[0];
   console.debug(`[ContextService] Validation completed in ${measure.duration.toFixed(2)}ms`);
   ```

2. **buildGraph()**
   - Logs: `Graph build completed in ${duration}ms`

3. **calculateImpact()**
   - Logs: `Impact analysis completed in ${duration}ms (${count} entities)`

#### GitService (3 operations)
4. **getStatus()**
   - Logs: `Status retrieved in ${duration}ms`

5. **getDiff()**
   - Logs: `Diff retrieved in ${duration}ms (file: ${path})`
   - Logs: `Full diff retrieved in ${duration}ms`

6. **commit()**
   - Logs: `Commit completed in ${duration}ms (${count} files)`

#### AIService (1 operation)
7. **startAssistStream()**
   - Per-stream tracking with unique IDs
   - Logs: `Stream completed in ${duration}ms (${chunkCount} chunks)`
   - Automatic cleanup of performance marks/measures

### Logging Pattern

All performance logs follow this structure:
```
[ServiceName] Operation completed in XXX.XXms (context)
```

**Examples:**
- `[ContextService] Validation completed in 1234.56ms`
- `[GitService] Commit completed in 89.12ms (3 files)`
- `[AIService] Stream completed in 5678.90ms (127 chunks)`

### Benefits

1. **Performance Visibility**: Easy to identify bottlenecks
2. **Debugging**: Rich context for troubleshooting
3. **Optimization**: Data-driven performance improvements
4. **Monitoring**: Track performance trends over time

### Example Output

```
[ContextService] Graph build completed in 234.56ms
[GitService] Status retrieved in 12.34ms
[AIService] Stream completed in 3456.78ms (89 chunks)
[ContextService] Impact analysis completed in 123.45ms (5 entities)
```

- Data stores (settings, credentials, telemetry)
- IPC communication patterns

**Communication Flows Documented:**
- **IPC Flow**: Renderer → Pinia → Preload → IPC → Main → Service → External
- **AI Streaming**: Child process stdout → IPC events → UI updates
- **File Watching**: fs.watch → Debounce → IPC broadcast → Store refresh

**Security Architecture:**
- Production CSP (no eval, no unsafe-inline scripts)
- contextBridge isolation
- Path traversal prevention
- Credential encryption

---

#### 3. C4 Component Diagram
**File:** `docs/architecture/c4-component.md`

**Shows:**
- Main process service layer breakdown
- IPC handler routing
- Service dependencies
- Error handling hierarchy
- Performance monitoring integration

**Services Documented:**
1. **ContextService**: Entity validation, graph building, impact analysis
2. **AIService**: AI assistance with streaming, timeout protection
3. **GitService**: Version control operations with path normalization
4. **FileSystemService**: Secure file operations with validation
5. **ContextBuilderService**: Repository scaffolding
6. **SpeckitService**: Spec kit workflows
7. **AssistantSessionManager**: Multi-session conversation state
8. **TelemetryWriter**: Tool invocation logging
9. **ProviderConfig**: AI provider and tool registry

**Data Flow Example:**
Complete walkthrough of AI assistance request from UI click to response rendering, showing:
- Renderer layer (Vue component → Pinia store)
- IPC bridge layer (preload scripts)
- Main process layer (handlers → services)
- External API layer (Azure OpenAI)
- Response propagation back to UI

## Lessons Learned

### TODO Management
- Generic TODOs create technical debt
- Document *why* something isn't implemented
- Clarify *when* it should be implemented
- Convert to GitHub issues only when actionable

### Performance Monitoring
- Performance API is lightweight and powerful
- Structured logging enables easy grep/search
- Per-operation context aids debugging
- Cleanup prevents memory leaks

### Architecture Documentation
- C4 diagrams scale well (context → container → component)
- Mermaid syntax is readable and version-controllable
- Documentation should explain *why*, not just *what*
- Include real examples (data flows, error scenarios)

## Future Enhancements (Beyond P3)

Based on TODO analysis, here are the most valuable future improvements:

### High Value
1. **Session Persistence** (assistantSessionManager)
   - Requires: Storage strategy decision (file vs. SQLite)
   - Benefit: Resume AI conversations after restart

2. **Checklist Metrics** (DeveloperHub)
   - Requires: Markdown parsing pipeline
   - Benefit: Track completion across prompt artifacts

3. **Analytics Integration** (router, routeGuards)
   - Requires: Telemetry service requirements
   - Benefit: Usage insights for product decisions

### Medium Value
4. **Granular Stream Events** (assistantBridge)
   - Requires: Backend streaming standardization
   - Benefit: Richer real-time UI updates

5. **Tool Configuration UI** (providerConfig)
   - Requires: Multi-tenant or RBAC needs
   - Benefit: Admin-driven tool enablement

### Low Value (Defer)
6. **Hunk Headers in Diffs** (writeContextPatch)
   - Current simplified diff sufficient for approval UI

7. **Log Rotation** (telemetryWriter)
   - Only implement if volume monitoring indicates need
