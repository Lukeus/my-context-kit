## P0 - Critical Fixes (Production Blockers)

### ‚úÖ P0.1: Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors
**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Impact:** HIGH - Blocks production deployment

**What Was Done:**
- Added `@vue/test-utils` package
- Verified `openai` package includes bundled types
- `pnpm typecheck` now exits with code 0

**Result:** TypeScript compilation stable ‚úÖ

---

### ‚úÖ P0.3: Fix Production CSP Security
**Time:** 20 minutes  
**Impact:** HIGH - Security vulnerability

**What Was Done:**
- Implemented environment-specific Content Security Policy
- Development: Allows `unsafe-eval` for Vite HMR
- Production: Strict CSP without `unsafe-eval`

**Result:** Production builds secure ‚úÖ

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è P0.2: Replace `any` Types (Deferred)
**Status:** DEFERRED to gradual improvement  
**Reason:** 163 warnings - requires systematic refactoring

**Decision:** Not a deployment blocker. Will be addressed incrementally in future sprints with focus on critical paths first.

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è P3.2: Resolve TODO/FIXME Comments
**Status:** DEFERRED

16 TODO/FIXME comments found in codebase. Address incrementally as part of feature work.

---

### ‚è∏Ô∏è P3.3: Performance Monitoring
**Status:** DEFERRED

Add performance.mark/measure for critical paths. Consider in future performance optimization sprint.
