# Phase 3 Implementation: Impact Analysis

**Status**: âœ… Complete  
**Date**: 2025-10-23

## Overview

Successfully implemented Phase 3 of the Context-Sync MVP, focusing on impact analysis features including consistency rules, stale item detection, and comprehensive UI components.

## Deliverables

### 1. âœ… Consistency Rules Engine

**File**: `context-repo/.context/rules/consistency.rules.yaml`

Implemented 6 consistency rules:
- `US-acceptance-change-flags-tasks`: Flags tasks/specs when user story acceptance criteria changes
- `feature-change-impacts-all`: Marks all related entities when a feature changes
- `service-version-bump-needs-consumer-review`: Flags consumers when service API changes
- `spec-change-impacts-implementations`: Marks implementing tasks when specs change
- `task-status-blocked-flags-feature`: Flags parent feature when task is blocked
- `package-dependency-change-impacts-consumers`: Flags consumers when package deps change

### 2. âœ… Enhanced Impact Pipeline

**File**: `context-repo/.context/pipelines/impact.mjs`

Enhancements:
- Loads and applies consistency rules from YAML configuration
- Generates `staleIds` array for entities that need review
- Enhanced impact report with `totalStale` statistic
- Each impacted entity includes `isStale` flag
- Rule-based issue generation with `ruleId` tracking

### 3. âœ… ImpactPanel Component

**File**: `app/src/renderer/components/ImpactPanel.vue`

Features:
- **4 tabs**: Overview, Issues, Stale, Diff (placeholder)
- **Overview tab**: 
  - Stats grid showing impacted entities, stale items, issues, needs-review count
  - Changed entities list
  - Top 3 issues preview
- **Issues tab**: 
  - Full list of all issues with type badges
  - Colored borders by issue type
  - Click to navigate to entity
- **Stale tab**: 
  - List of all stale entities
  - Status indicators
  - Entity type badges
- **Action buttons**:
  - Analyze Impact
  - Generate Prompt

### 4. âœ… Stale Highlighting in ContextTree

**File**: `app/src/renderer/components/ContextTree.vue`

Enhancements:
- Orange background and border for stale entities
- Orange ring for emphasis
- Warning triangle icon for stale items
- Orange text color for stale entity names
- Integration with impact store

### 5. âœ… Updated App Layout

**File**: `app/src/renderer/App.vue`

Changes:
- Replaced inline impact display with ImpactPanel component
- Cleaner 3-panel layout: ContextTree | Editor | ImpactPanel

## Testing Results

### Pipeline Tests

#### Validation Pipeline
```bash
node .context/pipelines/validate.mjs
```
**Result**: âœ… PASS
- All 9 entities validated successfully
- Distribution: 1 feature, 2 user stories, 1 spec, 3 tasks, 1 service, 1 package

#### Graph Building
```bash
node .context/pipelines/build-graph.mjs
```
**Result**: âœ… PASS
- 9 nodes created
- 26 edges with 9 different relationship types
- Correct relationships between entities

#### Impact Analysis
```bash
node .context/pipelines/impact.mjs FEAT-001
```
**Result**: âœ… PASS with Consistency Rules Applied
- Changed: FEAT-001
- Impacted: 8 entities (all related entities)
- Stale: 8 entities (all marked correctly)
- Issues: 14 (consistency rule "feature-change-impacts-all" applied)
- All impacted entities flagged with `isStale: true`

### Code Quality Tests

#### Linting
```bash
pnpm lint
```
**Result**: âœ… PASS (17 warnings about `any` types, no errors)

#### Type Checking
```bash
pnpm typecheck
```
**Result**: âœ… PASS (no compilation errors)

## Architecture Notes

### Data Flow
1. User selects entity in ContextTree
2. Clicks "Analyze Impact" in ImpactPanel
3. ImpactStore calls IPC handler
4. Main process spawns impact.mjs pipeline
5. Pipeline loads consistency rules
6. Pipeline builds graph and finds neighbors
7. Rules engine applies to all neighbors
8. Impact report generated with staleIds
9. ImpactPanel displays results in tabs
10. ContextTree highlights stale items

### State Management
- **contextStore**: Manages entities, graph, active entity
- **impactStore**: Manages impact reports, stale tracking, issues

### Consistency Rules Engine
- Rules loaded from YAML configuration
- Applied automatically during impact analysis
- Filters by entity type and relationship
- Generates structured issues with reasons

## Known Limitations

1. **Diff View**: Placeholder only - git diff integration pending
2. **Field-Level Change Detection**: Currently assumes all fields changed
3. **Git Integration**: No actual git history comparison yet
4. **Rule Conditions**: `fieldChanged` and `newValue` not fully implemented

## Future Enhancements (Phase 4+)

- [ ] Git diff integration for actual field change detection
- [ ] Diff view implementation showing before/after
- [ ] Advanced rule conditions (field-specific, value matching)
- [ ] Batch impact analysis for multiple changed entities
- [ ] Impact visualization in GraphView
- [ ] Export impact reports to markdown

## Screenshots

*Note: Run `pnpm start` to view the implemented UI*

### Expected UI Features
1. **ContextTree**: Orange-highlighted stale items with warning icons
2. **ImpactPanel Overview**: 4-stat grid with color-coded metrics
3. **ImpactPanel Issues**: Detailed issue list with type badges
4. **ImpactPanel Stale**: Filterable list of stale entities

## Conclusion

Phase 3 implementation is **complete and functional**. All core deliverables have been implemented:
- âœ… Impact pipeline with consistency rules
- âœ… ImpactPanel component with tabs
- âœ… Stale highlighting in ContextTree
- âœ… Diff view placeholder
- âœ… Consistency rules engine

The system now provides real-time impact analysis showing which entities need review when changes are made, with automatic rule-based flagging of affected items.

**Ready for Phase 4: Prompt Generation** ðŸš€
