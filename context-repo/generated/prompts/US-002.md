# User Story Blueprint: US-002

**Feature**: FEAT-001  
**Status**: proposed

## Persona & Intent
**As a** developer  
**I want** to visualize the dependency graph of my context entities  
**So that** I can understand how features, specs, tasks, and services are related

## Value Statement
- Clarify how this story advances the feature outcomes and constitution goals.
- Identify measurable success indicators for this persona.

## Scenario Matrix
- **Primary Flow**: _Describe the happy path interaction, referencing acceptance criteria._
- **Alternate Flows**: _Capture secondary journeys or permissions differences._
- **Edge Cases**: _List failure or exception handling expectations._

## Acceptance Signals
- [ ] Graph displays all entities as nodes
- [ ] Relationships are shown as edges
- [ ] Different entity types have different colors
- [ ] User can zoom and pan the graph
- [ ] Clicking a node shows entity details
- [ ] Graph includes a legend for entity types
- [ ] Graph is responsive to window resizing
- [ ] Graph updates in real-time when context changes
- [ ] Graph data source is clearly documented
- [ ] Graph performance is monitored for large repositories
- [ ] Graph errors are displayed with actionable feedback
- [ ] Graph supports filtering by entity type
- [ ] Graph supports exporting to common formats
- [ ] Graph includes a tooltip with entity details on hover
- [ ] Graph supports drill-down to entity details
- [ ] Graph has a loading state during data fetch
- [ ] Graph has an error recovery mechanism
- [ ] Graph is accessible according to project standards
- [ ] Graph documentation is available in the context repository
- [ ] Graph is version-controlled and follows the spec
- [ ] Graph meets the observability and feedback principles of the constitution

## Dependencies & Impact Radius
- _Document affected services, packages, or external systems._

## Outstanding Clarifications (Limit 3)
- _Record top uncertainties that block implementation._

## Test Signals & Instrumentation
- Define success metrics observable via UI, logs, or telemetry.
- Align with integration-first testing by identifying contract or end-to-end checkpoints.

## Next Actions
- Sync with feature checklist `US-002.checklist.md` to validate quality gates.
- Link derived tasks to `/speckit.tasks` style phases to maintain traceability.
