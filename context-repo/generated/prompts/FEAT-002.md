# Feature Blueprint: Feature builder (FEAT-002)

**Domain**: developer-tools  
**Status**: proposed  
**Owners**: _Unassigned_

## Intent Narrative
Provide an interactive builder UI to help authors create and assemble feature definitions, attach related user stories and tasks, and visualize dependency relationships between context entities. The builder should produce valid context YAML that can be validated by the project’s validation pipeline.

## Customer Outcomes
- Derive primary outcomes from objective and acceptance signals.

## Scope Definition
### In Scope
- _Infer concrete inclusions during clarification; capture in checklist._
### Out of Scope
- _Document explicit exclusions to protect team boundaries._

## Success Criteria (Technology-Agnostic)
- _Translate acceptance criteria into measurable outcomes before planning._

## Dependencies & Interfaces
- **Requires**: svc-git

## Linked Execution Artifacts
- **Stories**:
	- US-002 — to visualize the dependency graph of my context entities (unknown)

## Outstanding Clarifications (Limit 3)
- _Capture the top three ambiguities impacting scope, security, or UX._

## Assumptions In Play
- _Record explicit assumptions so they can be validated or removed._

## Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements
- _Enumerate performance, compliance, and operational constraints._

## Constitution Gates
- _Align this feature with the governance constitution before planning._

## Next Actions
- Review `FEAT-002.checklist.md` and close outstanding items.
- Resolve clarifications or log them for `/speckit.clarify`-style follow-up.
- Ensure linked specs, stories, and tasks share a coherent success narrative.
