# Feature Blueprint: Context-Sync MVPs (FEAT-001)

**Domain**: developer-tools  
**Status**: in-progress  
**Owners**: _Unassigned_

## Intent Narrative
Build a desktop application that manages a GitHub-versioned context repository for spec-driven software development with automated consistency checking.

## Customer Outcomes
- Derive primary outcomes from objective and acceptance signals.

## Scope Definition
### In Scope
- _Infer concrete inclusions during clarification; capture in checklist._
### Out of Scope
- _Document explicit exclusions to protect team boundaries._

## Success Criteria (Technology-Agnostic)
- _Translate acceptance criteria into measurable outcomes before planning._

## Dependencies & Interfaces
- **Requires**: svc-git

## Linked Execution Artifacts
- **Stories**:
	- US-001 — to validate my context repository against defined schemas (proposed)
	- US-002 — to visualize the dependency graph of my context entities (proposed)
- **Specs**:
	- SPEC-001 — Validation Pipeline Implementation (technical)
- **Tasks**:
	- T-001 — Implement validation pipeline script (done)
	- T-002 — Set up Electron Forge app with Vue and Tailwind (done)
	- T-003 — Build core UI components (todo)

## Outstanding Clarifications (Limit 3)
- _Capture the top three ambiguities impacting scope, security, or UX._

## Assumptions In Play
- _Record explicit assumptions so they can be validated or removed._

## Constraints & Non-Functional Requirements
- _Enumerate performance, compliance, and operational constraints._

## Constitution Gates
- Spec-Driven Development Compliance — high (applies to: feature)

## Next Actions
- Review `FEAT-001.checklist.md` and close outstanding items.
- Resolve clarifications or log them for `/speckit.clarify`-style follow-up.
- Ensure linked specs, stories, and tasks share a coherent success narrative.
